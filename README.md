# OrcMaps

An offline-first map engine for embedded devices. ESP32-class hardware
(ESP32-S3, ESP32-P4) is the first target; the core is deliberately platform-
portable so other microcontroller-class devices can adopt it later.

OrcMaps renders useful, readable maps entirely from local storage (SD card) —
no network connection required to display a map. It owns base geography
(roads, water, boundaries, place labels) and a small set of generic drawing
primitives (markers, polylines, polygons). It does **not** know what an
aircraft, a LoRa node, or an RF site is — applications translate their own
domain data into OrcMaps overlays.

[`hardcoreerik/OrcSDR`](https://github.com/hardcoreerik/OrcSDR) is the first
consumer, replacing its prototype `ORCMAP1` implementation. OrcMaps is built
so unrelated ESP32 projects can use it too.

## Status

Early development. The map-pack container format is decided (PMTiles v3 —
see [`docs/FORMAT_DECISION.md`](docs/FORMAT_DECISION.md)). Implemented and
host-tested: PMTiles archive reader, Web Mercator tile math, MVT container
decode (schema-agnostic), OrcMaps Feature / Geometry model, MVT→Feature
translation, and the style system. An ESP-IDF compile/link smoke test
exists at [`examples/generic-esp32`](examples/generic-esp32) and does
**not** require M5GFX. A host framebuffer render proof exists (no M5GFX).
M5GFX `DisplayTarget` is an optional exported adapter
(`#include "orcmap/m5gfx/display_target.hpp"`). Viewport enumerates
visible tiles (X wrap, no overzoom).
A hardware-verified static Springfield render exists on M5Stack Tab5
([`examples/m5stack-tab5`](examples/m5stack-tab5); evidence
[`docs/evidence/TAB5_SPRINGFIELD_HARDWARE.md`](docs/evidence/TAB5_SPRINGFIELD_HARDWARE.md)).
A second Springfield hardware demo for the LilyGO T-Display-S3 Touch +
SD Shield is physically verified under ESP-IDF 5.5.4
([`examples/lilygo-tdisplay-s3`](examples/lilygo-tdisplay-s3); evidence
[`docs/evidence/LILYGO_TDISPLAY_S3_SPRINGFIELD_HARDWARE.md`](docs/evidence/LILYGO_TDISPLAY_S3_SPRINGFIELD_HARDWARE.md)).
That demo writes a new numbered timing report to the SD card after every
successful render, avoiding a USB serial dependency.
Not production-ready: no pan/zoom, no labels. FeatureKind mapping is
experimental. See [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md).

## Design principles

1. **Offline first.** A downloaded map pack must render with zero network access.
2. **One basemap, many applications.** Base geography is shared; every consumer supplies its own overlays.
3. **Bounded memory.** Map/pack size must never determine RAM usage — everything streams.
4. **Portable core.** No application state (aircraft, nodes, RF data) inside the engine.
5. **Graphics-framework-independent core.** M5GFX is the first *reference integration* because OrcSDR/Tab5 is the first real consumer — it is not the renderer architecture.
6. **Map data is not firmware.** Packs install/update independently of the engine and the consuming app.
7. **User data is not map-pack data.** Markers/waypoints survive pack replacement, are never uploaded during pack discovery.
8. **Safe updates.** A corrupt or partial download never replaces a working pack.
9. **Provenance matters.** Every pack carries source, license, attribution, and hash metadata — enforced by a machine-readable registry (`data/sources/`) and CI, not just documented. See [`docs/DATA_AND_LICENSING.md`](docs/DATA_AND_LICENSING.md).
10. **No unauthorized tile scraping.** Packs are built from legitimate extract data (e.g. OSM `.pbf` extracts), never bulk-scraped raster tile servers.

See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md).

Map **data** distributed alongside this engine (e.g. prebuilt map packs) is
subject to its own source license (typically OpenStreetMap's ODbL) —
engine licensing and data licensing are independent. See
