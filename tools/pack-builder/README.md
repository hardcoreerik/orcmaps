# Pack builders (host-only)

## Natural Earth world-overview sources

`world_overview_sources.json` pins the 21 official Natural Earth 5.1.2
archives used for the proposed 110m/50m/10m overview tiers. Acquire and
verify them outside Git with:

```
python tools/pack-builder/acquire_world_overview_sources.py \
  --destination data/local/world-overview/natural-earth
```

Use `--dry-run` to list the destination, total bytes, and URLs without
network access. The script preserves the ZIPs, extracts the required
shapefiles, verifies size and SHA-256, and writes local `SOURCE.json` and
`SHA256SUMS.txt` records. Existing invalid archives are refused unless
`--force` is explicit. This acquires source data only; it does not build a
PMTiles pack or select final zoom cutoffs.

## Regional packs

`build_regional_pack.py` extracts a bbox or GeoJSON region from an existing
PMTiles archive using the official `go-pmtiles` CLI, then writes the immutable
OrcMaps triplet:

```
<name>.pmtiles
<name>.manifest.json
<name>.sha256
```

It requires all identity, provenance, compatibility, and attribution inputs;
it never guesses them or contacts a metadata service. `--dry-run` prints the
exact command and deterministic pack ID without creating files. Existing
artifacts are refused unless `--force` is explicit. The content profile is
manifest metadata: extraction preserves the source archive's layers and does
not pretend to transform one schema/profile into another.

Run `python tools/pack-builder/build_regional_pack.py --help` for the complete
noninteractive interface. Example:

```
python tools/pack-builder/build_regional_pack.py \
  --source D:/maps/planet.pmtiles \
  --bbox=-124.7,41.9,-116.4,46.3 --min-zoom 0 --max-zoom 14 \
  --content-profile standard --output D:/maps/oregon.pmtiles \
  --region-id US-OR --region-name "Oregon, USA" --display-name Oregon \
  --source-snapshot 2026-09 --source-version 2026-09 --source-label planet.pmtiles \
  --source-sha256 <verified-source-sha256> --provenance-id openstreetmap \
  --acquired 2026-09-14 --pack-version 2026.09.1 --pack-class open \
  --attribution "© OpenStreetMap contributors" \
  --attribution-link https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \
  --builder-version 1.28.2 --builder-commit <orcmaps-commit>
```

The `go-pmtiles` executable must be on `PATH`, or supplied with
`--pmtiles-cli`. It is a host provisioning tool, never a device/runtime
dependency.

## Springfield / 97477 source build

Reproducible OSM → PMTiles path for the first real-geography host preview.
This is **pack production**, not an OrcMaps runtime dependency. Planetiler
is not vendored and is not linked into the engine.

Do not treat the resulting layer schema as the OrcMaps tile-content
decision. Inspect tiles with `tools/pack-inspect` first.

## Geographic test area

Springfield, Oregon / ZIP 97477 urban bbox (WGS84, west/south/east/north):

```
-123.055, 44.030, -122.960, 44.090
```

Center used for the 1280×720 preview (not hardcoded in core):

```
44.0500 N, 123.0220 W
```

This bbox is test geography. It is not an application concept.

## Source (provenance)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | Geofabrik OSM extract |
| URL | https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/oregon-latest.osm.pbf |
| Format | `.osm.pbf` (OSM Protocolbuffer Binary) |
| License | ODbL 1.0, © OpenStreetMap contributors |
| Provenance record | `data/sources/openstreetmap.json` (`CONFIRMED`) |
| Acquisition | raw extract; **not** `tile.openstreetmap.org` raster tiles |

Record the download date and SHA-256 in `data/local/SOURCE.txt` when you
run the script.

## Toolchain

| Tool | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Planetiler 0.10.2 | OSM PBF → PMTiles v3 / MVT | `planetiler.jar` (OpenMapTiles profile 3.16.0). Requires Java 21. Build-tool only. |
| OrcMaps `pack-inspect` | inspect / preview | Uses the engine; not a tiler. |

Exact versions are printed by `build_springfield_pack.ps1`.

## Output contract

```
PMTiles v3
TileType = MVT
tile_compression = gzip
maxzoom = 15
```

Brotli/zstd are not used. OrcMaps does not implement those codecs.

## Commands

From the repository root (PowerShell, Temurin JDK 21):

```
pwsh tools/pack-builder/build_springfield_pack.ps1
```

Artifacts land in `data/local/` (gitignored):

```
data/local/oregon-latest.osm.pbf
data/local/springfield-97477.pmtiles
data/local/springfield-97477.manifest.json
data/local/springfield-97477.sha256
data/local/SOURCE.txt
```

Then:

```
cmake -S tools/pack-inspect -B build-pack-inspect -G "Visual Studio 18 2026"
cmake --build build-pack-inspect --config Release
build-pack-inspect/Release/orcmap_pack_inspect.exe header data/local/springfield-97477.pmtiles
build-pack-inspect/Release/orcmap_pack_inspect.exe preview data/local/springfield-97477.pmtiles --out data/local/springfield-97477-orcsdr-dark.ppm
```

## Natural Earth world overview

`build_world_overview.py` builds one z0-z8 master from the already provisioned
Natural Earth 5.1.2 files, then uses official go-pmtiles v1.28.2 to derive z7
and z6 candidates, plus the z5 and z4 firmware-fallback candidates. It validates the local source hashes, source record, Java,
Planetiler, and go-pmtiles versions before running. It never downloads data or
tools.

```powershell
python tools/pack-builder/build_world_overview.py `
  --source-root data/local/world-overview/natural-earth/5.1.2 `
  --planetiler-jar data/local/planetiler.jar `
  --pmtiles-cli data/local/tools/go-pmtiles/v1.28.2/pmtiles.exe `
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` to build. Existing immutable outputs are refused unless
`--force` is explicit. PMTiles, manifests, checksums, compiled classes, and
renders remain under ignored `data/local/world-overview/build/`.

## provision_pack.py -- pin to SD card

`provision_pack.py` is the PC half of a device setup wizard. Where
`build_regional_pack.py` takes full provenance on the command line,
this takes a pin and a radius and derives everything else from the
**source pack's own manifest**, so a cut pack cannot record a provenance
that disagrees with what it was cut from.

```bash
python tools/pack-builder/provision_pack.py \
  --source-manifest data/local/oregon.manifest.json \
  --lat 44.0521 --lon -123.0867 --radius-km 50 \
  --name home-eugene --display-name "Home: Eugene OR" \
  --sd-root G:/ --builder-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

It writes `<sd-root>/orcmaps/<name>.pmtiles` plus the `.manifest.json` and
`.sha256` sidecars **on the same filename stem**, which is how
`src/core/pack_discovery.cpp` pairs an archive to its manifest. Renaming one
without the others is the single mistake that silently breaks discovery, so
staging moves all three or none.

Behaviour that matters:

- A pin outside the source pack's coverage is **refused**, rather than
  producing an empty pack that looks valid.
- A box that overruns the source is **clamped to the source's coverage**, so
  the manifest never claims tiles the archive lacks (the device compares the
  two and rejects a mismatch).
- The requested zoom range is **narrowed** to what the source holds.
- stdout is machine-readable JSON; the `pmtiles` CLI's progress goes to
  stderr so a wizard can parse the result.

Measured on an 84 MB Oregon source, z1-13 (go-pmtiles 1.28.2):

| Radius | Tiles | Pack size | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 25 km | 384 | 4.06 MB | 276 ms |
| 50 km | 1,218 | 7.34 MB | 249 ms |
| 100 km | 4,526 | 20.30 MB | 295 ms |
