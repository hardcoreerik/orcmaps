# pack-inspect (host-only)

Inspect a PMTiles archive through the real OrcMaps pipeline, or render a
1280×720 preview. Visible-tile enumeration here is **preview scaffolding**,
not the production Viewport API.

```
cmake -S tools/pack-inspect -B build-pack-inspect -G "Visual Studio 18 2026"
cmake --build build-pack-inspect --config Release
```

```
orcmap_pack_inspect header ARCHIVE
orcmap_pack_inspect tile ARCHIVE Z X Y
orcmap_pack_inspect sample ARCHIVE --lat LAT --lon LON --zoom Z [--radius N]
orcmap_pack_inspect preview ARCHIVE --lat LAT --lon LON --zoom Z
    [--out FILE --style ID --verbose]
```

Style ids: `orcsdr-dark`, `standard-light`, `high-contrast-field`,
`night-red-safe`.

Springfield / 97477 host preview (pack from `tools/pack-builder`):

```
build-pack-inspect/Release/orcmap_pack_inspect.exe preview data/local/springfield-97477.pmtiles --lat 44.0500 --lon -123.0220 --zoom 14 --style orcsdr-dark --out data/local/springfield-97477-orcsdr-dark.ppm
```

Generated images are gitignored. Do not treat a committed PPM as project
truth.
